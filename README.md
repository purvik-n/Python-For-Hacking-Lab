# üêç Python-For-Hacking-Lab

### **A Structured Portfolio for Offensive Security Skill Development**

---

## üë®‚Äçüíª Overview & Career Focus

This repository serves as a practical learning log, documenting my progress toward becoming a proficient **Junior Penetration Tester** with a long-term career focus on **Red Team Operations**.

The projects within are built from scratch in Python, demonstrating hands-on skill in automating security tasks, analyzing network protocols, and developing custom offensive tools within a safe, isolated lab environment.

## üéì Learning Pillars (The "T-Shaped" Skillset)

My current intensive study plan is centered around mastering these core domains required for advanced security:

| Pillar | Focus | Deliverables in this Repo |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I. Scripting & Automation** | **Python (Primary)**, Bash, and PowerShell. | Custom Scanners, Password Crackers, Web Enumerators. |
| **II. Systems & Networking** | In-depth TCP/IP, OSI Model, Network Scanning, and Linux/Windows Command-line tools. | Network Packet Spoofer, ARP Detectors, Host Discovery Tools. |
| **III. Practical Hacking** | Penetration Testing Methodology, OWASP Top 10, and Adversary Simulation. | Documented Proofs-of-Concept (PoCs) and structured lab reports. |
